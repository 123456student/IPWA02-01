                        Ghost Nets are abandoned fishing nets that float through the open ocean.

                        Fish, marine mammals and birds can get tangled up in these abandoned nets. As these animals are usually unable to free themselves again, more often than not this means certain death by starvation or suffocation.

                    <p class="m-0">
                        We developed GhostNets.org. On this website everyone can join the battle against ghost nets by reporting them when they see them on the ocean or near the shore. Once a net is reported people with the necessary equipment find them on GhostNets.org and go recover them. Once that is done they can report that as well so other people know it is not going to pose a danger to the marine wildlife anymore.
